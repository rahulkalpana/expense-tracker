To achieve the objective of developing an Express server for managing expenses with the specified requirements, you can follow these steps:

Set up your Express server:

Initialize a new Node.js project and install Express using npm.
Create a new Express server file (e.g., server.js) and set up the basic server configuration.
Define your expense model:

Define a schema for expenses with fields like Date, Amount, Description, Frequency, and Base.
You can use a library like Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database provided by Strapi.
Implement CRUD operations:

Create routes for handling CRUD operations for expenses (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Use appropriate HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to handle these operations.
Handle recurring expenses:

For expenses with frequencies other than "One-Time," implement a Node.js cron job using libraries like node-cron.
Set up a scheduled task to update recurring expenses daily by incrementing the amount based on the specified frequency.    
Connect to the Strapi database:

Utilize the publicly accessible database hosted via Strapi at strapi.koders.in for storing expense data.
Configure your application to connect to this database using the appropriate credentials.
Test your implementation:

Use tools like Postman to test your API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting expenses.
Verify that recurring expenses are being updated correctly based on the specified frequency.
By following these steps, you can develop an Express server that effectively manages expenses, including recurring expenses, within the specified environment. If you encounter any specific challenges or need further assistance with any of these steps, feel free to ask for help.
